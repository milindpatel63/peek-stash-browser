 * on. A `tv` scope: an arrow moves focus to the nearest item in that
 * direction by position (`utils/spatialFocus.ts`), inside the popover or
 * dialog that holds focus (`focusRoot`), else inside the top modal when one
 * is open (the dispatcher hands a modal's unused arrows here), else the
 * whole page. PageUp and PageDown are left to the page's own scope. On a
 * closed select the arrows move focus too and Enter opens it; on a slider Up
 * and Down move focus while Left and Right change its value (the rules are
 * `targetOwnsKey`'s in TV mode). In a single-line text field Up and Down
 * move focus, and Left and Right once the caret is at that edge (at once in
 * a number or date field, which shows the page no caret: `caretAtEdge`), so
 * a field never strands the controls beside it.
 *
 * After a route change it focuses the first `[data-tv-item]` in `<main>`
 * once one renders, unless focus is still inside `<main>` (a list keeps it in
 * its search box), moved on meanwhile (the Scene page focuses its player) or
 * a dialog is open.
