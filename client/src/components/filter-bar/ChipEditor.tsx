 * date or text row) applies 300 ms after the last key, and closing applies
 * what still waits. The first commit of an open editor adds a history
 * entry and later ones replace it, so Back undoes the whole edit.
 *
 * The draft is never re-read from the URL: the editor's own commits come
 * back canonical (an imperial height typed as 5 ft 10 in stays as typed),
 * and a list change that is not one of them (Back) closes it. A commit
 * that empties the row removes it from the list (later rows of the field
 * move up a number), and the editor stays open as a new row of that field
 * after its last, so a later pick adds that row and never edits the row
 * that took the old number.
 *
 * Its header (`ChipEditorHeader`) names the field and offers Remove; with
 * `pinning`, it also pins the field to the bar ("Pin <field>") and the
 * row's value as a one-tap filter ("Pin as quick filter"), or unpins them.
