/**
 * Process handlers: the graceful shutdown on SIGTERM and SIGINT, and the
 * last-resort handlers.
 *
 * `docker stop` sends SIGTERM and kills the container 10 s later. The
 * server is PID 1 in the image, and nginx goes with it when it exits.
 * The shutdown stops the syncs and the zip queue, closes the HTTP server, waits for the
 * migrations and the sync, refreshes the planner statistics, checkpoints the
 * WAL into the database file and disconnects, so the next start (or a copy
 * of the data volume) finds everything in `peek-stash-browser.db`.
 *
 * An uncaught exception leaves the process in an unknown state (Node documents
 * that resuming is unsafe), so it is logged and the process exits with code 1;
 * the container's restart policy brings the server back. An unhandled promise
 * rejection leaves no half-run synchronous code, so it is logged and the
 * server keeps serving.
