/**
 * The one writer queue for the process: every database write that can hold
 * SQLite's write lock for more than a moment goes through here, one unit at
 * a time, in arrival order.
 *
 * The rule (server-sql.md, "Writes"): every transaction (batch or
 * interactive), every multi-row statement (`createMany`, `INSERT ... SELECT`,
 * a whole-table `UPDATE`, a chunked delete) and every single-row write on a
 * user path (ratings, favorites, O counts, plays, image views, hides, stats,
 * playlists, restrictions) is a `dbWrite` unit, and no unit holds the write
 * lock longer than DB_WRITE_HOLD_WARN_MS (1 s) on a 200k-scene library:
 * longer work is chunked (per sync batch, per user, per 5,000 rows) so user
 * writes interleave FIFO with it. A unit that breaks the bound is logged
 * with its label. Reads never queue: under WAL they wait only for a pool
 * connection and an engine worker, never for the writer. Single-row writes
 * off the user paths (settings, setup, groups, themes, carousels, downloads,
 * auth) stay autocommit: they take the lock inside the engine and wait up to
 * busy_timeout (5 s), which the 1 s bound keeps safe.
 *
 * Why a queue in Node and not the engine's own waiting: Prisma opens an
 * interactive transaction with BEGIN IMMEDIATE, and its SQLite driver waits
 * for the write lock inside the query engine, on one of the engine's worker
 * threads (one per CPU), for busy_timeout. Were concurrent writers to wait
 * there, a few of them would occupy every worker thread, the one holding the
 * lock could not run its next statement, and they would all time out on a
 * small machine (P1008). Here a waiting unit holds no pool connection and no
 * engine thread; on the probe (40 hides at once on a 16-CPU box) that turns
 * 32 failures into 40 commits.
 *
 * Nesting: the queue is a `createSerialQueue` (utils/serialQueue.ts), whose
 * units run inside an AsyncLocalStorage context, and a `dbWrite` called from
 * within one would wait for itself. In tests and development (NODE_ENV test
 * or development, or the server running from TypeScript source) it throws
 * "dbWrite re-entered: <outer> -> <inner>"; in production it runs inline
 * with logger.error, as given (no retry: inside an outer transaction that
 * would outlive it), so a missed case costs a log line and not a deadlock.
 * Inside a `dbWriteTransaction` callback, write through `tx`.
 * Never take the compute connection (`withComputeConnection`) inside a unit:
 * the order is always compute connection first, then the writer queue.
 *
 * Retries: a busy failure (an outside holder such as the sqlite3 CLI, or a
 * statement that outlived busy_timeout) means nothing was committed, so `fn`
 * runs again from the start until DB_WRITE_LOCK_WAIT_MS has passed; it must
 * not keep state between attempts. Any other error, the transaction's own
 * timeout (P2028) included, is thrown at once and the queue released.
 *
 * The queue is a Node mutex, not tied to a client: a unit may write through
 * the compute client too (D3 swaps a user's exclusions that way).
