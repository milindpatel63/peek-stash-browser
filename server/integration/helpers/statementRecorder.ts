/**
 * Records the statements code sends while it runs, with their parameters, on
 * the main Prisma client and on the clients of the interactive transactions it
 * opens, with how many were in flight at once.
 *
 * `vi.spyOn` cannot wrap Prisma's client proxy (it finds no property
 * descriptor and installs a stub that swallows the call), so the wrappers go
 * on by hand and `restore()` puts the originals back. A transaction's client
 * reads its raw SQL methods from the main client, calling them with itself
 * as `this`: the wrappers keep that `this` (a wrapper bound to the main
 * client would send the transaction's statements outside it) and tell the
 * two apart by it. Its model delegates are its own, so they are recorded
 * through a Proxy handed to the transaction's callback.
 *
 * While it records, a raw statement is a plain promise that runs at once, so
 * a `dbWriteBatch` of them would not be one transaction: record code that
 * sends statements one at a time.
