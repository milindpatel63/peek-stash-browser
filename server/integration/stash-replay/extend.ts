/**
 * The replay fixture's extension of the recorded graph (sweep item 83).
 *
 * The test Stash alone is smaller than what E2E needs (30 or more scenes, a
 * performer with 12 scenes and 3 images, markers, a rated scene with a
 * caption), so the generator adds a fixed set of entities before it builds
 * values. The additions depend only on the shape, so the output stays
 * deterministic:
 * - scenes continuing the ids up to EXTENDED_SCENE_COUNT, each with P* (the
 *   recorded performer with the most scenes) as its only performer, no
 *   tags, and the studios in turn; the first is rated 80 and has a caption
 * - EXTENSION_IMAGES images with P* as their only performer and no gallery
 * - EXTENSION_CLIPS markers on the first recorded scene, with the lowest
 *   tag as their primary tag
 * - around G (see below), a collection hierarchy the test Stash lacks: a
 *   group containing G, described "Box set", when G is in none, and a group
 *   inside G, described "Part 2", when G contains none, numbered after the
 *   recorded groups. Each link is listed from both ends (a group's
 *   sub_groups and the other's containing_groups) with the same
 *   description. Live runs skip the test of it (GroupRelations.integration),
 *   since the test Stash has no sub-groups.
 * An added entity has every recorded field set and one of each list.
 *
 * The recorded entities stay as they are, but for one rule, "relations the
 * test Stash lacks that integration tests need". Each relation joins two
 * recorded entities and is added only where it is missing. S is the studio
 * the tests use (studioWithScenes: the lowest recorded studio with two or
 * more scenes) and G the group (groupWithScenes: the lowest recorded group
 * with scenes):
 * - G gets S as its studio (and S lists G among its groups), for
 *   groups.integration "returns group studio with tooltip data"
 * - the lowest recorded scene of S joins G when no scene of S is in a group,
 *   for studios.integration "returns groups with tooltip data" (Peek lists
 *   a studio's groups from its scenes)
 * - S gets the lowest recorded tag, for studios.integration "returns tags
 *   with image_path"; it changes no TEST_ENTITIES pick
 * - the lowest recorded gallery with no studio gets S, when no gallery has
 *   S, for studios.integration "returns galleries with tooltip data"
 * The counts follow from the relations (synth.ts). Live runs still skip
 * those tests until the test Stash has these relations.
