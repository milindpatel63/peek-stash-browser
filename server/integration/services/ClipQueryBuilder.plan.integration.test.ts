/**
 * Query plans of the clip list against real SQLite (S5), as SQLite makes
 * them for a large library (`largeLibraryPlanner`).
 *
 * The default list (live, generated, newest first) walks
 * `StashClip_browse_idx`, whose columns are the whole ORDER BY with the
 * primary key and then the columns the filters read before the scene
 * (the title, generated, the scene's key), and reads each clip's scene by
 * its key, so the page stops after its rows and sorts nothing. (With
 * statistics the count checks each scene live on
 * `StashScene_id_stashInstanceId_deletedAt_idx`, which holds `deletedAt`,
 * from the index alone.)
 * A scene tag reads each junction by its tag index, the inherited one too,
 * and matches the list on the clip's own scene columns before the scene is
 * read.
 * With statistics a studio drives from its own scenes (without them SQLite
 * walks the clips, so no plan here pins it). What the lists hold is pinned
 * by `ClipQueryBuilder.integration.test.ts`; the timings at 207k and 300k
 * clips are in the commit that added this file.
