/**
 * Typed deep mock of the Prisma client for unit tests.
 *
 * Every model method and `$` method is a `vi.fn()`, created on first access
 * and typed with vitest's own deep mock types, so
 * `mockPrisma.user.findUnique.mockResolvedValue(...)` is checked against the
 * real Prisma signature. `$transaction` behaves like Prisma's by default: an
 * array of calls resolves with `Promise.all`, a callback runs with the mock.
 *
 * Tests mock the singleton with
 * `vi.mock("../../prisma/singleton.js", () => import("../helpers/prismaSingletonMock.js"))`
 * and read it back with `vi.mocked(prisma, true)`.
