/**
 * A second Prisma client pinned to one SQLite connection, for work that keeps
 * TEMP tables between statements (the exclusion recompute).
 *
 * TEMP tables live on one connection, and the main client pools several. An
 * interactive $transaction would pin a connection too, but Prisma opens it
 * with BEGIN IMMEDIATE on SQLite: the database write lock is held for the
 * whole transaction even when it only reads, so playback pings, ratings and
 * sync writes queue behind it. This client runs its statements outside any
 * Prisma transaction on its single connection, so under WAL it takes no
 * write lock on the main database.
 *
 * The connection's TEMP namespace is shared by everything that uses this
 * client, so `withComputeConnection` runs its callers one at a time, and
 * `readSnapshot` gives them a deferred read transaction to compute in.
