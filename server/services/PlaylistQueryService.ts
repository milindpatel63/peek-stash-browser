/**
 * What a viewer sees of playlists (items 41.6 and 41.7): the playlists
 * page's previews and counts, and a playlist's items with their scenes.
 *
 * An item is visible when its scene, matched on the item's own instance, is
 * live (`deletedAt IS NULL`), on one of the viewer's allowed instances, and
 * not excluded for the viewer (the exclusion anti-join with the instance).
 * The viewer is whoever reads: a shared playlist's recipient sees what their
 * own exclusions allow, never the owner's view (invariants 3, 10 and 11). An
 * item with no instance, saved before multi-instance, matches no scene.
 *
 * Every playlist's previews come from one statement driven by the playlist
 * ids (`json_each` with `CROSS JOIN`s, so SQLite looks each item and scene up
 * by key). A playlist's items go through `loadPlaylistItems`: a page of the
 * visible items in SQL in the view's sort (`orderTerms`), or every visible
 * item without paging (the zip's read), and their scenes from the scene
 * builder, whose joins carry the viewer's own rating, favorite, O and play
 * fields. The play queue (`loadPlaylistQueue`) is every visible item in the
 * same order, in one statement, with the few fields the player's sidebar
 * shows. Nobody is told about the items they cannot see, except the owner,
 * who gets their count (`countUnavailableItems`) and can remove the ones
 * deleted from Stash (`removeUnavailableItems`).
 *
 * Adds go through `appendItems`: the scenes the adder can see, numbered
 * after the playlist's last item inside the insert itself. "Save as
 * playlist order" goes through `sortPlaylistItems`, in the same order. A
 * reorder moves one item at a time (`moveItem`), renumbering the playlist
 * 0..n-1.
