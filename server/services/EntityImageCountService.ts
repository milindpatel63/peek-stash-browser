 * - Images can be "loose" (standalone) or inside galleries
 * - Images inside galleries inherit metadata from their parent gallery
 * - An image counts toward a performer/studio/tag if:
 *   1. The entity is directly associated with the image, OR
 *   2. The entity is associated with a gallery containing the image
 *
 * A full sync recounts every entity; an incremental sync recounts only the
 * ones its changes reach (`ImageCountScope`). Sync writes a new entity with
 * Stash's direct count and never overwrites the stored count on update.
 *
 * PERFORMANCE: Uses SQL aggregation instead of loading all images into memory.
 * This scales to millions of images without memory issues.
