/**
 * The related entities the performer, studio, tag and collection cards list
 * in their tooltips (item 41.2), capped per card in SQL, with how many there
 * are.
 *
 * One statement per relation serves a whole page. It drives from the page's
 * parents, bound as one JSON parameter of (id, instance) pairs, and lists for
 * each parent the related entities the user can see: most shared scenes
 * first (through a junction of the related entity's own, such as a tag's
 * performers, the largest first), then by name and id, at most
 * TOOLTIP_LIMIT, and counts them all in `relation_totals`. A card's own tags
 * are listed whole, by name. A studio's performers are only counted: the
 * studio card's performers indicator shows a number and no tooltip.
 *
 * The related entities the user can see, as the list rows' nested refs:
 * live (deletedAt IS NULL), with no UserExcludedEntity row for the user
 * (global or on the entity's instance), and on the parent's instance, which
 * the list already held to the user's allowed instances. A path through
 * scenes takes only the scenes the user can see (live, with no
 * UserExcludedEntity row for the user on the scene's instance), so a
 * performer's card never names a studio or collection it shares only a
 * deleted or hidden scene with, and such a scene adds nothing to the order.
 *
 * The refs are the list rows' nested refs (`query/nestedRefs.ts`): names,
 * images and links, never Stash's own favorite or rating.
