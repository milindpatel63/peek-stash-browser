/**
 * Recommended scenes: one ranked list per user, scored once per change.
 *
 * Scoring reads every scene the user can see (`getScenesForScoring`: the
 * exclusions, the allowed instances and the watch data applied in SQL),
 * weighs each by the user's favorites, ratings, rated scenes and engagement
 * rankings, and keeps the diversified top 500 as (id, instance) refs, about
 * 50 KB. The list is reused while the user's stamp is unchanged: one query
 * (about 3 ms at 200k scenes) over the count and newest change of the
 * user's four rating tables, watch history, rankings and scene exclusions,
 * and the scene sync state. A rating, favorite, play, hide, restriction,
 * ranking recompute or scene sync changes it and the next page rescores.
 * The cache key also carries the day (the daily shuffle seed) and the
 * allowed instances, so a new day or an instance selection change rescores.
 *
 * Rankings are refreshed (at most once an hour) by page 1 of the
 * Recommended list, which waits for a recompute, by login and by the stats
 * page; later pages start none, so a user's pages are scored with one set of
 * rankings.
 *
 * The cache holds the 100 most recently served users, in process memory,
 * keyed by user id: no user is ever answered with another's list. Callers
 * arriving while a list is being computed share the computation, and a
 * failed computation is dropped, so the next request tries again.
 *
 * Every entity key is entityKey(id, instanceId): two Stash servers reuse
 * small ids, and a favorite on one says nothing about the other.
