/**
 * ExclusionComputationService
 *
 * Computes and maintains the UserExcludedEntity table which stores
 * pre-computed exclusions for each user. This enables efficient
 * JOIN-based filtering instead of loading exclusions into memory.
 *
 * Exclusion sources:
 * - UserContentRestriction (admin restrictions) -> reason='restricted'
 *   (EXCLUDE closures, INCLUDE inversion and the content rules)
 * - UserHiddenEntity (user hidden items) -> reason='hidden'
 *   (the stored row, its descendants and its per-instance copies)
 * - Cascades from EXCLUDE closures and hides -> reason='cascade'
 * - Empty organizational entities -> reason='empty'
 *
 * The compute is raw SQL end to end (item 13). Listed and hidden ids are
 * user-written: they are bound as JSON, never spliced into SQL text. Every
 * closure and exclusion set is loaded once into a TEMP table with a primary
 * key on (id, inst), so each membership test is an indexed lookup. TEMP
 * tables live on one connection, so the compute runs on the single-connection
 * compute client (prisma/computeClient.ts), one recompute at a time, inside a
 * deferred BEGIN: a read snapshot that takes no write lock, where a Prisma
 * interactive transaction (BEGIN IMMEDIATE) would hold the database write lock
 * for the whole compute.
 *
 * The write phase is set-based on the same connection: the deduplicated rows
 * go into the TEMP table _peek_result (bound as JSON, 20,000 rows per
 * statement, no main-database lock), then one short BEGIN IMMEDIATE deletes
 * the user's rows and inserts the new ones with INSERT ... SELECT (the
 * `exclusions.swap` writer unit). On a 180k-row user the lock is held for
 * well under a second, where a createMany of the same rows held it for over
 * three. A restriction save (saveRestrictions) computes from the proposed
 * rows and writes them in that same BEGIN IMMEDIATE, ahead of the
 * exclusions, so a failure anywhere leaves both tables as they were. The
 * swap also rewrites UserExcludedContentCount, the viewer's excluded links
 * per entity (from _peek_counts), and a hide's unit increments it for the
 * rows it adds; the builders subtract it from the live count columns, so a
 * card equals the tab's total (B13b).
 *
 * Who exclusions apply to lives in exclusionPolicy.ts: an admin's rows hold
 * only their own hides and cascades, so no read path needs a role check.
 *
 * Reason precedence. UserExcludedEntity holds one row per (user, type, id,
 * instance); when an entity qualifies several ways, the first reason in this
 * order is stored:
 *   1. restricted: EXCLUDE closures and INCLUDE inversion (direct)
 *   2. cascade: cascades of those EXCLUDE closures
 *   3. restricted: content rules
 *   4. empty: entities the user's hides cover that are empty under the
 *      restrictions alone
 *   5. hidden: the user's hides, their descendants and per-instance copies
 *   6. cascade: cascades of the hides
 *   7. empty: empty under every exclusion
 * Rows 1 to 4 are exactly what a recompute with no hides would store for
 * these keys, so a row whose reason is 'hidden' marks an entity the user
 * would see if they had hidden nothing. EntityAccessService reads that for
 * the Hidden Items list. addHiddenEntities keeps it true between recomputes
 * by never overwriting an existing row.
