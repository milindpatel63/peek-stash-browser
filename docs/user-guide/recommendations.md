# Recommendations

Get personalized scene suggestions based on your favorites and ratings.

## How It Works

Peek learns your preferences from your activity:

- **Favorited performers** - Scenes featuring performers you've favorited
- **Highly-rated performers** - Scenes with performers you've rated 7.0+
- **Favorited studios** - Scenes from studios you've favorited
- **Highly-rated studios** - Scenes from studios you've rated 7.0+
- **Favorited tags** - Scenes with tags you've favorited
- **Highly-rated tags** - Scenes with tags you've rated 7.0+
- **Scene ratings** - Similar scenes to ones you've rated highly

The more you rate and favorite, the better your recommendations become!

## Accessing Recommendations

### Recommended Page

Click **Recommended** in the navigation menu to see a full page of personalized suggestions.

The page shows:

- Scenes matching your preferences
- Pagination for browsing more results
- Your current activity stats

### Recommended Sidebar

When viewing a scene, the sidebar shows related recommendations:

- Similar performers
- Same studio
- Matching tags

## Building Your Profile

### Getting Started

If you're new to Peek, you'll see a message explaining how to get recommendations:

1. **Favorite performers** you enjoy
2. **Rate scenes** you watch (especially 7.0+)
3. **Favorite studios** that consistently produce content you like
4. **Favorite tags** for your preferred categories

### Activity Indicators

The Recommended page shows your current activity:

```
Your current activity:
• 5 favorited performers, 3 highly-rated
• 2 favorited studios, 1 highly-rated
• 8 favorited tags, 4 highly-rated
• 15 favorited scenes, 42 rated scenes
```

This helps you understand what's driving your recommendations.

## Tips for Better Recommendations

### Rate Generously

Rate scenes you watch, even if just quickly:

- **7.0+** = Scenes similar to this will be recommended
- **Below 7.0** = Won't negatively affect recommendations, but won't boost similar content

### Favorite Strategically

Favorites have strong weight in recommendations:

- Favorite your **top performers** (not just ones you like)
- Favorite **studios** whose content you consistently enjoy
- Favorite **tags** for categories you always want to see

### Explore Hidden Gems

Recommendations can surface scenes you might have missed:

- Older content from favorite performers
- Other scenes from studios you've rated highly
- Scenes with multiple matching tags

## How Recommendations Are Scored

Scenes are scored based on multiple factors:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Favorited performer in scene | High |
| Highly-rated performer in scene | Medium-High |
| Favorited studio | Medium |
| Highly-rated studio | Medium |
| Favorited tags (each) | Low-Medium |
| Highly-rated tags (each) | Low |

Scenes matching multiple criteria score higher and appear first.

## Excluding Scenes

Already seen a recommendation? Don't want to see it again?

1. Click the **Hide** button on the scene card
2. The scene won't appear in recommendations again
3. Hidden scenes can be restored from Settings > Hidden Items

## Recommendations vs. Random

| Feature | Recommendations | Random Sort |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Personalized | Yes | No |
| Based on ratings | Yes | No |
| Surfaces old content | Yes | Yes |
| Repeatable | Yes (same preferences = same results) | No (different each session) |

Use **Recommendations** when you want curated content. Use **Random** when you want to discover without preferences.

## Troubleshooting

### "No Recommendations Yet"

This appears when you haven't rated or favorited enough content:

1. Browse scenes and rate some 7.0+
2. Favorite a few performers you enjoy
3. Return to Recommendations

### Recommendations seem repetitive

If you're seeing the same scenes:

1. Hide scenes you've already watched
2. Rate more scenes to expand your profile
3. Favorite more diverse performers/tags

### Recommendations don't match my taste

Your recommendation profile might need tuning:

1. Review your favorites (Settings > remove any accidental favorites)
2. Rate more scenes to give the algorithm more data
3. Remember: ratings 7.0+ strongly influence results
