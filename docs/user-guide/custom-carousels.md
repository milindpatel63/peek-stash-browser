# Custom Carousels

Create personalized homepage carousels using a visual query builder. Custom carousels let you define filter rules to automatically curate collections of scenes based on performers, tags, ratings, and more.

## Creating a Custom Carousel

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Homepage Carousels**
2. Click **Create Carousel**
3. Configure your carousel:
   - **Title**: Give your carousel a descriptive name
   - **Icon**: Choose from a selection of icons
   - **Filter Rules**: Add one or more rules, and optionally groups of rules, to define which scenes appear
   - **Sort**: Choose how scenes are ordered (Random, Recently Added, etc.). Playlist order needs exactly one playlist rule, and Scene Number needs a collection rule, each at the top level (not inside a group) with the top level set to Match all; without that rule the sort is not offered, and removing the rule puts the sort back to Random

4. Click **Preview** to see matching scenes
5. Click **Save** once you're satisfied with the preview

## Filter Rules

Rules are edited in the same row editor as the **Advanced** view of the lists (see [Advanced Filters](browse-and-display.md#advanced-filters)). Each rule is a row with a filter, a condition and a value. The **Match** select at the top says whether a scene needs every rule (**Match all**, the default) or any one of them (**Match any**).

- The row at the end, "Add a filter...", adds a rule.
- A row's actions menu (the three dots) moves it to another group or the top level, or removes it.
- **Add group** adds a box of rules with its own Match select. Groups go one level deep.
- The same filter can be used twice, as in two Tags rows: one "has all of" and one "has any of".
- In a Match any group, rows on the same filter that each say "has any of" combine into one rule when you save, and a line under the group says so.
- A saved rule the editor has no row for shows as "A rule this editor can't show" with a **Remove** button. It stays in the carousel, as it is, until you remove it.

### Favourites of Any Kind

To show scenes you favorited in any way, whether the scene, a performer, a studio or a tag:

1. Click **Add group** and set the group to **Match any of these**.
2. In the group, add **Favorite Scenes**, **Favorite Performers**, **Favorite Studios** and **Favorite Tags**, and set each to Yes.
3. Title it, for example "Favourites of any kind", then Preview and Save.

A scene appears when it matches at least one of the four. Add rules at the top level to narrow it further, such as **Watched** set to No for the favorites you have not seen.

### Comparison Operators

Different filter types support different operators:

- **Entity filters** (Performers, Tags, Studios, Galleries, Playlists): Has ANY of these, Has ALL of these, Has NONE of these. Collections: In ANY of these, NOT in these. Where the Scenes page offers them, a pick can be excluded instead of included, and **Has none** / **Has any** match scenes with no such relation at all; both are saved with the rule.
- **Numeric filters** (Rating, Duration, etc.): a minimum, a maximum, or both
- **Resolution**: Equals, Not Equals, Greater Than, Less Than. A new Resolution rule starts at Equals, as on the Scenes page; a saved rule keeps its condition.
- **Date filters** (Created Date, Updated Date, Scene Date, Last Played Date): pick a start date, an end date, or both. A start alone matches later dates, an end alone earlier dates, and both the dates in between. Date rules are saved with the carousel and shown again when you edit it.
- **Yes / No filters** (Favorites, Organized, Has Markers, Duplicated, Watched, In Progress, In any of my playlists): Yes or No
- **Text filters**: contains, and for Path also excludes, equals and starts with

## Managing Carousels

### Reordering

Use the up/down arrow buttons next to each carousel to change the display order on your homepage.

### Visibility

Click the eye icon to show/hide individual carousels. Hidden carousels remain saved but won't appear on the homepage.

### Editing

Click the pencil icon on any custom carousel to modify its rules, title, or icon. A saved rule the editor cannot show is kept as it is when you save, until you remove it. **Back** with changes you have not saved asks **Discard changes?** first.

### Deleting

Click the trash icon to delete a custom carousel. This action cannot be undone.

## Limits

- Maximum of **15 custom carousels** per user
- Each carousel displays up to **12 scenes**
- Up to **20 rules** and **5 groups** per carousel (rules that combine in a Match any group count once)
- The top level and each group are Match all (every rule) or Match any (one rule is enough)

## Tips

- **Start simple**: Begin with one or two rules and add more as needed
- **"Or" needs a group**: To mix "this or that", put those rules in a Match any group, or set the top level to Match any
- **Use Preview**: Always preview before saving to ensure your rules work as expected
- **Random sort**: Great for variety - shows different scenes each time you visit
- **Combine with favorites**: Create carousels for "Highly rated scenes with favorite performers"
- **Content restrictions**: Custom carousels respect your hidden items and content restrictions, in every group: a Match any group never shows something you hid
- **See More**: A carousel's See More opens the Scenes page with the same rules, groups included

## Troubleshooting

### Carousel shows "No scenes found"

- Your filter rules may be too restrictive
- Try relaxing some rules or using different operators
- Check that you have scenes matching your criteria

### Carousel not appearing on homepage

- Make sure the carousel is enabled (eye icon should be visible, not crossed out)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check Settings → Homepage Carousels to verify it's toggled on
