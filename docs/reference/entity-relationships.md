# Entity Relationships

This document describes the data model relationships between Peek's cached entities. Understanding these relationships is essential for working with content filtering, queries, and the sync system.

## Entity Types

Peek mirrors Stash's entity model, caching entities locally in SQLite. This enables:

- **Performant queries** — No network round-trips to Stash for library browsing
- **Per-user features** — Content restrictions, hidden items, ratings, favorites, watch history
- **Offline resilience** — Library remains accessible if Stash is temporarily unavailable

| Entity | Stash Source | Peek Cache Table | Notes |
|--------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Scene | Yes | `StashScene` | Primary content type |
| Performer | Yes | `StashPerformer` | |
| Studio | Yes | `StashStudio` | Has parent/child hierarchy |
| Tag | Yes | `StashTag` | Has parent/child DAG |
| Group | Yes | `StashGroup` | Has parent/child hierarchy (containing_groups/sub_groups) |
| Gallery | Yes | `StashGallery` | Contains Images |
| Image | Yes | `StashImage` | |
| Clip | Yes (scene markers) | `StashClip` | A timed section of a scene; Stash calls it a scene marker |
| Playlist | Peek-only | `Playlist` | User-created scene collections, shareable with groups |

Every cached entity is keyed by its id and its Stash server (instance): the entity tables use the primary key `(id, stashInstanceId)`, and the junction tables carry the instance of both ends, so two Stash servers can hold the same id without mixing. Peek's own per-user tables call the instance `instanceId`.

## Scene Relationships

| Related Entity | Cardinality | Junction Table | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Studio | Many-to-One | — | `StashScene.studioId` |
| Performer | Many-to-Many | `ScenePerformer` | |
| Tag | Many-to-Many | `SceneTag` | |

## Performer Relationships

| Related Entity | Cardinality | Junction Table | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Scene | Many-to-Many | `ScenePerformer` | Inverse of Scene→Performer |
| Tag | Many-to-Many | `PerformerTag` | |
| Image | Many-to-Many | `ImagePerformer` | |
| Gallery | Many-to-Many | `GalleryPerformer` | |
| Group | — | — | Computed by Stash (performers appearing in group's scenes) |

---

## Studio Relationships

| Related Entity | Cardinality | Junction Table | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Scene | One-to-Many | — | Inverse of Scene→Studio |
| Tag | Many-to-Many | `StudioTag` | |
| Image | One-to-Many | — | `StashImage.studioId` |
| Gallery | One-to-Many | — | `StashGallery.studioId` |
| Parent Studio | Many-to-One | — | `StashStudio.parentId` |
| Child Studios | One-to-Many | — | Inverse of parentId |
| Group | — | — | Computed by Stash (groups with this studio) |

## Tag Relationships

| Related Entity | Cardinality | Junction Table | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Scene | Many-to-Many | `SceneTag` | Inverse of Scene→Tag |
| Performer | Many-to-Many | `PerformerTag` | Inverse of Performer→Tag |
| Studio | Many-to-Many | `StudioTag` | Inverse of Studio→Tag |
| Group | Many-to-Many | `GroupTag` | Inverse of Group→Tag |
| Gallery | Many-to-Many | `GalleryTag` | Inverse of Gallery→Tag |
| Image | Many-to-Many | `ImageTag` | Inverse of Image→Tag |
| Clip | Many-to-Many | `ClipTag` | Inverse of Clip→Tag |
| Clip (primary tag) | One-to-Many | None | `StashClip.primaryTagId` (with `primaryTagInstanceId`) |
| Scene (inherited) | Many-to-Many | `SceneInheritedTag` | Scenes that inherit the tag from a performer, studio or group |
| Parent Tags | Many-to-Many | — | `StashTag.parentIds` (JSON array) |
| Child Tags | Many-to-Many | — | Inverse, resolved at runtime |

!!! note "Tag Hierarchies"
    Tag hierarchies form a DAG (directed acyclic graph), not a tree. Tags can have multiple parents.

---

## Clip Relationships

A clip is a Stash scene marker, cached as `StashClip`.

| Related Entity | Cardinality | Junction Table | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Scene | Many-to-One | None | `StashClip.sceneId` and `sceneInstanceId`; the clip is deleted with its scene |
| Primary Tag | Many-to-One | None | `StashClip.primaryTagId` and `primaryTagInstanceId` |
| Tag | Many-to-Many | `ClipTag` | The marker's other tags |

Clips carry the start (`seconds`) and an optional end (`endSeconds`), and the paths of the preview, screenshot and stream. A clip's scene filters read the scene's tags and its inherited tags.

---

## Group Relationships

| Related Entity | Cardinality | Junction Table | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Scene | Many-to-Many | `SceneGroup` | Includes `sceneIndex` for ordering |
| Tag | Many-to-Many | `GroupTag` | |
| Studio | Many-to-One | — | `StashGroup.studioId` |
| Containing Groups | Many-to-Many | `GroupRelation` | Rows where the group is the sub-group (`subId`) |
| Sub Groups | Many-to-Many | `GroupRelation` | Rows where the group contains (`containingId`); `orderIndex` keeps Stash's order |

!!! note "Group Hierarchy"
    Stash stores the group hierarchy as one table, and its `containing_groups` and `sub_groups` are the same links read from either end. Peek keeps it the same way: one `GroupRelation` row per link, from the containing group to the sub-group, with the sub-group's place in the list (`orderIndex`) and Stash's description of the link (`description`, e.g. "Part 2"). Both groups are keyed on their instance; a link never crosses Stash servers. Every sync reads the whole hierarchy again, since Stash's sub-group edits move no group's `updated_at`.

| Scene | Many-to-Many | `PlaylistItem` | Includes `position` for ordering |
| User | Many-to-One | — | `Playlist.userId` |
| Group | Many-to-Many | `PlaylistShare` | One row per group the playlist is shared with; recipients see only what their own exclusions allow |

## Metadata Inheritance

Peek pre-computes inherited metadata during sync to enable efficient filtering and consistent behavior.

### Scene Tag Inheritance

Scenes inherit tags from their associated performers, studio, and groups. This enables tag-based filtering to work transparently across all related entities.

**Inheritance sources:**

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Performer Tags | Tags on any performer in the scene |
| Studio Tags | Tags on the scene's studio |
| Group Tags | Tags on any group the scene belongs to |

**Key rules:**

- **No duplication**: Tags already directly on the scene are not added to inherited tags
- **Deduplicated**: Same tag from multiple sources (e.g., two performers) appears once
- **Stored separately**: Inherited tags are stored apart from direct tags: as the `inheritedTagIds` JSON column on `StashScene` and as `SceneInheritedTag` rows (one per scene and tag, indexed by tag). The tag filters and counts read the rows
- **When computed**: After every full sync, and after an incremental or smart sync in which a scene changed or a performer's, studio's or group's tag set changed

**Query behavior:**

When you filter scenes by tag, Peek searches both direct tags AND inherited tags. This means:

- Filtering by a performer's tag shows scenes with that performer
- Filtering by a studio's tag shows scenes from that studio
- Content restrictions on tags apply to inherited tags too

**Example:** If performer "Jane" has tag "Comedy", all scenes with Jane will match a "Comedy" tag filter, even if the scene itself isn't tagged "Comedy".

### Image Gallery Inheritance

Images inherit metadata from their parent gallery when the image's own field is empty. This ensures images in a gallery share consistent metadata without manual duplication.

**Inherited fields:**

| Field | Inheritance Rule |
|-------|------------------|
| Performers | Inherit if image has no performers |
| Tags | Inherit if image has no tags |
| Studio | Inherit if image has no studio |
| Date | Inherit if image has no date |
| Photographer | Inherit if image has no photographer |
| Details | Inherit if image has no details |

**Key rules:**

- **Never overwrites**: Only copies when image field is NULL/empty
- **All-or-nothing for relationships**: Performers and tags only inherit if image has NONE
- **Multi-gallery handling**: Studio, date, photographer and details come from the first gallery, in gallery ID order, that has a value. Performers and tags come from every gallery the image is in, added together
- **When computed**: After every full sync, and after any sync that wrote images (even unchanged ones, whose junction rows sync rewrites) or changed galleries

!!! note
    Image `title` is NOT inherited — each image keeps its own name.

**Example:** A gallery has studio "Acme" and tags "Nature", "Landscape". An image in that gallery with no metadata will inherit all three. An image with its own studio but no tags will keep its studio and inherit the tags.
