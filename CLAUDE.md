# Peek Stash Browser

Self-hosted web app for browsing and streaming media from one or more Stash servers, with playlists, ratings and per-user content restrictions. Ships as a single Docker image.

## What Peek is

What Peek adds to Stash, and the invariants every change keeps. `.claude/rules/` has the detail per area.

- Users and access: ADMIN and USER accounts; groups grant Can Share, Download Files and Download Playlists (denied by default; a per-user override beats groups); recovery keys; trusted-header SSO; login rate limit and lockout; a setup wizard.
- Per-user data, keyed by user and instance: ratings and favorites on all 7 entity types, watch history and resume points, O counts, image views, stats, hidden items, presets, carousels, themes and other preferences. Rating, favorite, O-count and play fields in responses are the requesting user's, not Stash's.
- Content restrictions: an admin gives a user Show-only and Always-hide lists of collections, tags, studios and galleries (tags and studios include their descendants; Always-hide wins), cascading to the entities they cover; precomputed into `UserExcludedEntity`.
- Multi-instance: one Peek in front of several Stash servers. Each user picks which enabled instances to see, as a preference, not access control.
- Media: streams, captions and images go through Peek; the external player gets a personal signed link (12 h). Named playlists shareable with groups, TV mode, timeline and folder views, recommendations and similar scenes from the user's own data.
- Downloads: scene files and playlist zips with NFO, permission-gated and queued.
- Operations: a synced SQL cache of each library, merge reconciliation, per-user Sync to Stash and Sync from Stash, database backups.

Invariants:

1. No user needs, sees or receives Stash credentials. The API key never leaves the server; Stash's address reaches only admins.
2. Every request that shows or serves Stash content is authenticated as a Peek user: a session, or on the direct stream a personal signed link.
3. A user's exclusions (restrictions, hidden items, cascades) apply on every surface that lists, counts, recommends, shows or serves an entity, by-id lookups, downloads and media included. One exception: the image proxy serves a user the images of items they hid themselves (not restricted ones), so the Hidden Items page shows thumbnails; streams and captions stay refused.
4. Only admins set restrictions, and never on admin accounts; users cannot bypass them. Hidden items belong to the user who hid them.
5. Admins bypass restrictions; everyone's own hidden items apply to them everywhere, except in the admin's Content Restrictions editor, which lists everything so an admin can restrict what they hid.
6. No user sees another user's data, except shared playlists and admin exclusion counts. Deleting a user deletes all their data.
7. Everything stored about a Stash entity carries its instance.
8. Peek never edits Stash metadata. It writes to Stash only through Sync to Stash, which only an admin can switch on for a user.
9. Sharing and downloading are denied by default and enforced on the server.
10. Sharing never widens access: a recipient sees only what their own exclusions allow.
11. Instance selection only narrows what a user sees: disabled instances never show, and an empty selection means all enabled instances.

## Commands

- Dev: `docker compose up --build -d` (client on :6969, server on :8000); `docker compose logs -f peek-server`. Each container reinstalls `node_modules` when `package-lock.json` changed, and the server regenerates its Prisma client, so no `-V` is needed.
- Shared types: `cd shared && npm run build`. Needed before server `tsc`, the server dev runtime and client `typecheck`; Vite and Vitest read `shared/types` directly.
- Test: `npm run test:run` in `client/` and `server/` (`npm test` starts watch mode in a terminal)
- Coverage gate: `npm run test:coverage` in both; CI enforces the thresholds in each `vitest.config`
- Integration, in `server/`: `npm run test:integration:replay` runs against the synthetic replay of the test Stash and needs no setup. `npm run test:integration` runs against the live test Stash (`STASH_TEST_*` in the root `.env`; `STASH_URL` only with `ALLOW_PROD_STASH=1` in the shell). From the root, `npm run fixtures:generate` rebuilds the fixture offline after a query change; `npm run fixtures:record` (owner) re-records after the test Stash changes. `-- --check` reports drift.
- E2E: `npm run test:e2e` from the root. It is hermetic: it starts a Stash replay, its own server and client, and a throwaway database, on ports derived from the checkout path, beside the dev stack. `E2E_BASE_URL=http://localhost:6969` runs it against the dev stack for manual runs on real data, as a throwaway run admin deleted afterwards; `.env.e2e` then names the bootstrap admin that creates it.
- Test suites in two worktrees can run at once; each worktree gets its own ports and databases.
- Lint: `npm run lint` in `client/` and `server/`
- Format: `npm run format` from the root; CI runs `npm run format:check`. `.prettierignore` leaves out `docs/`, `.claude/` and generated code.
- Types: `cd server && npm run typecheck` (source, then tests) and `cd client && npm run typecheck` (CI runs both)
- Schema: `cd server && npm run db:drift` after any change to `schema.prisma` or a migration; it must print an empty migration (CI checks it)
- Build: `cd client && npm run build`
- Release: `/pre-release`, then `/release-beta` or `/release-stable`

## Conventions that differ from defaults

- Every cached Stash entity belongs to an instance. The 8 entity tables key on `@@id([id, stashInstanceId])` and junctions on 4-part keys. Every query, lookup and cache key carries the instance; one without it mixes data across servers silently.
- One entity ID has three spellings. DB: bare `id` plus `stashInstanceId` (Peek's own per-user tables call it `instanceId`). API, URLs and filter values: `"id:instanceId"` (`InstanceAwareId` and `parseEntityRef` in `shared/types/instanceAwareId.ts`; `compositeKey.ts` in the client). In-memory Maps: `entityKey(id, instanceId)` from `server/utils/entityRef.ts` (`` `${id}\0${instanceId}` ``), with `compositeKey()` for a key of other parts; lint rejects a key built by hand. Convert at the API boundary, and keep the instance after parsing.
- Filters and sorts are declared once in `shared/types/filters`: the client's options and the server's parser read them, and a new filter starts there.
- Libraries reach 100k+ scenes. Filter and paginate in SQL; never load or loop over the whole library per request.
- Database writes queue through `dbWrite` in `server/utils/dbWrite.ts`: every transaction, multi-row statement and user-path write is one unit, and no unit holds the write lock longer than 1 s (lint rejects `prisma.$transaction` elsewhere). See `.claude/rules/server-sql.md`, "Writes".
- Migrations are written by hand (see `.claude/rules/prisma.md`). Never run `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma db push`.
- Tests live in `client/tests/` and `server/tests/`, mirroring the source tree, never beside the source.
- Server tests and `integration/` are type-checked by `server/tsconfig.tests.json` with the source flags (`npm run typecheck:tests`; plain `tsc` skips them). Client `typecheck` includes its tests. Mock Prisma in server tests with `tests/helpers/prismaMock.ts` (see `.claude/rules/tests.md`).
- Lint ratchet: `eslint-suppressions.json` holds counts that may only fall; after fixing suppressed sites run `npx eslint . --prune-suppressions`; never add entries.
- Releases push the version-bump commit straight to main and tag it. That is the only push to main without a pull request.
- Rules for specific areas live in `.claude/rules/` and load with the files they cover. Plans and design docs go in `docs/plans/`, which is gitignored: they stay local.

## Pitfalls

- A filter or content restriction silently matches nothing, or INCLUDE mode hides everything: an `"id:instanceId"` value reached SQL unparsed (#412, #424).
- A filter or restriction also matches another instance's entities: the value was parsed to a bare ID and the instance dropped (#390, #437).
- The dev server runs code with a TypeScript error: tsx strips types without checking them, so only `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit` (also run in CI) reports it. After a schema change, a Prisma `Invalid ... invocation` error ending in `Unknown argument` is the container's stale Prisma client: `docker compose restart peek-server` regenerates it (a host `npx prisma generate` does not reach the container's `node_modules`).
- A replay run fails with "stash-replay cannot answer …": the message names the operation and the field. Run the command it gives.
- In dev-stack E2E runs (`E2E_BASE_URL`), logins fail for 15 minutes after a few bad attempts: the account lockout lives in server memory. `docker compose restart peek-server` clears it.
